# Lesson 12 - While Loops

# Recap 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
# Create a program to check if a number is both divisible by 3
# and 5.

# 1. Ask the user to input a number
# 2. Using the '%' operator, check if the number is both a
#    multiple of 3 and 5:
#     If true, print "The number is divisible by 3 and 5!"
# 3. Else, print "The number is not divisible by 3 and 5"



bruh = int(input("What is the number?"))
if bruh % 3 == 0 and bruh % 5 == 0:
    print("The number is divisible by 3 and 5!")
else:
    print("The number is not divisible by 3 and 5!")


# Task 1: Introduction to while loop
# **Task 1a**:
# Due to a pandemic, the government placed a limit to the number
# of visitors a venue can have.

# Using a 'while' loop, create a program that will increase the
# number of visitors by 1 before printing out the number of
# visitors admitted, until number of visitors reaches 50.

# 1. Create a 'visitors' variable and assign '0' to it
# 2. While there is less than 50 visitors,
#     I. Increase the visitor count by 1
#     II. Print the visitor count

# (For Task 1b & 1c)
# Modify your program to account for the number of visitors
# already present at the venue, and the number of maximum visitors
# allowed for the following:

# **Task 1b**:
# Visitors already present: 18
# Max visitors allowed: 30

# **Task 1c**:
# Visitors already present: 4
# Max visitors allowed: 25

gyat = 0
while gyat < 50:
    gyat += 1
    print("Number of visitors admitted:", gyat)

visitors = 18
max_visitors = 30
while visitors < max_visitors:
    visitors += 1
    print("Number of visitors admitted:", visitors)

visitors = 4
max_visitors = 25
while visitors < max_visitors:
    visitors += 1
    print("Number of visitors admitted:", visitors)



# Task 2: while... break
# A restaurant used to have a max capacity of 50. However, due to
# the worsening of the pandemic, the government has restricted the
# max capacity of the restaurant to 30.

# Using an 'if' condition and 'break' within the 'while' loop,
# modify your answer for Task 1a to terminate the 'while' loop when
# number of visitors is 30.
