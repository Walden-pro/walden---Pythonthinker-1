## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
# Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
# students:
# Adam: 60
# Brandon: 58
# Charlie: 98
# Daniel: 79
# total: 60 + 58 + 98 + 79 = 295
# divide:73.75
# 1. Start
# 2. Initialize total_score to 0
# 3. Add Adam's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 60)
# 4. Add Brandon's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 58)
# 5. Add Charlie's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 98)
# 6. Add Daniel's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 79)
# 7. Calculate the number of students (num_students = 4)
# 8. Calculate the average score (average_score = total_score / num_students)
# 9. Print the average_score
# 10. End
# 
# 
# 
# 


## Task 2: Simple addition calculator
# **Task 2a**:
# Create 2 variables holding 2 different numbers:
# Print out the sum ("+") of the 2 numbers
# Print out the subtraction ("-") of the 2 numbers
# Print out the product ("*") of the 2 numbers
# Print out the division ("/") of the 2 numbers





#num1 = 19978
#num2 = 456

#print(num1 - num2)
#print(num1 * num2)
#print(num1 + num2)
#print(num1 / num2)

#print( 2 + 4 * 5 / 6 + 3 - 6 / 2)

## Task 3: Mathematics with variables
# For each of the following questions, create variables to hold
# the values given before finally using print(ans) to print the
# answer:

# **Task 3a**:
# Create 2 variables 'a' and 'b', assign any number to
# them and print their sum.
a = 29
b = 69
print(a + b)
# **Task 3b**:
# Subtract 10 from 50, then multiply the result by 3.
print((50 - 10) * 3)
# **Task 3c**:
# Divide 100 by 4 and print the result.
print(100 / 4)
# **Task 3d**:
# Calculate and print the result of (3 + 4) * 5 - (10 / 2).
print((3 + 4) * 5 - (10 / 2))
# **Task 3e**:
# Calculate and print the result of 3 / 2.
print(3 / 2)

## VARIABLES QUIZ
# Which of the following are INVALID variable names?

# 1. variable1
# 2. 1variable   
# 3. 1
# 4. one                                                           2,9,8,10,3
# 5. num1
# 6. num_1
# 7. Num_1
# 8. num 1
# 9. num-1
# 10. class

# Lesson 4 - Strings

## Recap 1: Sushi Checkout

# You just had a lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to
# calculate the total amount you have spent. Different coloured
# plates costs different as shown below:

# Red = $1
# Blue = $2
# Green = $3

# You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates, and 4
# green plates.

# Calculate and print the total amount you have spent: -->



red = 1
blue = 2
green = 3
print( (green * 4) + (blue * 5) + (red * 3))

## Task 1: Storing and printing Strings

# **Task 1a**:
# Use the input() function to ask the user for their name and
# store it in a variable. Then print that variable.

# **Task 1b**:
# Ask the user for their favorite colour using input() and
# store the response in a variable. Print the variable.

# **Task 1c**:
# Ask the user for their age using input() and store the answer
# in a variable. Print the variable.




Name = input("What is your name?")
print(Name)

Colour = input("What is your favourite colour?")
print(Colour)

Age = input("What is your age?")
print(Age)


## Task 2: Input & string concatenation

# **Task 2a**:
# Ask the user for their name using input() and store it in a
# variable. 
# Concatenate the name with "Hi, [name]!" and print the
# complete message.

# **Task 2b**:
# Use input() to ask the user for their favorite hobby. Store this
# in a variable.
# Print a message saying "I enjoy [hobby]" using string
# concatenation.

# **Task 2c**:
# Ask the user for their dream vacation destination using input()
# and store it in a variable.
# Concatenate this variable with a phrase like "I would love to
# visit" and print the full sentence.




name = input("what is your name")
print("hi " + name + "!")

hobby = input("what is your hobby")
print("I enjoy " + hobby)

vacation = input("where is your dream vacation")
print("I would love to visit " + vacation)



# **Task 3a**:
# 1. Ask the user for their current age using input(). Convert this
# to an integer.
# 2. Add 1 to their age and convert it back to a string.
# 3. Then print a message saying "Next year, you will be [age+1]
# years old."

# **Task 3b**:
# 1. Use input() to ask the user for a number. Convert this number
# from a string to an integer.
# 2. Double the number and convert it back to a string.
# 3. Print "Double your number is [double the number]".

# **Task 3c**:
# 1. Use input() to ask the user for the year they were born and
# convert it to an integer.
# 2. Subtract the birth year from the current year (assume the
# current year as an integer) to find their age.
# 3. Convert the age back to a string and print "You are [age]
# years old".






birth_year = input("What year were you born? ")
birth_year = int(birth_year)  # Convert to integer
current_year = 2025  # Assume the current year is 2025
age = current_year - birth_year  # Calculate age
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")  # Convert to string and print

number = input("Enter a number: ")
number = int(number)  # Convert to integer
double_number = number * 2  # Double the number
print("Double your number is " + str(double_number))  # Convert to string and print
