# Lesson 11 - AND OR NOT

# Recap 1: Purchase Advisor
# Create a program that asks the user for the price of an item (px) and
# gives a comment based on the price:

# if:
#     px <= 5: "Sounds good!"
#     px <= 50: "Are you sure you need this?"
#     px <= 500: "Where are you getting this money from?!"
#     px > 500: "Don't even think about it!"
 
# px = int(input("The price of the item: $"))
# if px <= 5:
#         print("Sounds good!")
# elif px <= 50:
#     print("Are you sure you need this?")
# elif px <= 500:
#     print("Where are you getting this money from?!")
# else:
#     print("Don't even think about it!")



# Task 1: AND Operator in Simple Conditions (AND)
# You are writing a program for an amusement park that needs to check
# if both riders of a ride are above the height of 120cm. Use the 'and'
# operator to determine if value of both 'rider1' and 'rider2' are
# greater than 120.

# 'rider1' = 125
# 'rider2' = 150
rider1 = 125
rider2 = 150

result = rider1 and rider2 >= 240
print(result)
