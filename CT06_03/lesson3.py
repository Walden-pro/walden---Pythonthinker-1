## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
# Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
# students:
# Adam: 60
# Brandon: 58
# Charlie: 98
# Daniel: 79
# total: 60 + 58 + 98 + 79 = 295
# divide:73.75
# 1. Start
# 2. Initialize total_score to 0
# 3. Add Adam's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 60)
# 4. Add Brandon's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 58)
# 5. Add Charlie's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 98)
# 6. Add Daniel's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 79)
# 7. Calculate the number of students (num_students = 4)
# 8. Calculate the average score (average_score = total_score / num_students)
# 9. Print the average_score
# 10. End
#

## Task 2: Simple addition calculator
# **Task 2a**:
# Create 2 variables holding 2 different numbers:
# Print out the sum ("+") of the 2 numbers
# Print out the subtraction ("-") of the 2 numbers
# Print out the product ("*") of the 2 numbers
# Print out the division ("/") of the 2 numbers






num1 = 19978
mun2 = 456

print(num1 - num2)
